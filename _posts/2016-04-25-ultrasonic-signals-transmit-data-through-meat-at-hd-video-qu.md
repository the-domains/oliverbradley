description: 'Modern medical implants are hobbled by slow download speeds. Most medical devices transmit data over radio frequencies at the relatively glacial pace of fewer than 50 kilobytes per second. At that rate, it can take ages for physicians to transfer data or reprogram devices. New evidence suggests ultrasonic signals could speed up that process.'

<article style=""><h1>Ultrasonic Signals Transmit Data Through Meat at HD Video Quality</h1><p>Modern medical implants are hobbled by slow download speeds. Most medical devices transmit data over radio frequencies at the relatively glacial pace of fewer than 50 kilobytes per second. At that rate, it can take ages for physicians to transfer data or reprogram devices. New evidence suggests ultrasonic signals could speed up that process.</p><img src="http://spectrum.ieee.org/img/MEAT-1461158779655.jpg" /></article>
